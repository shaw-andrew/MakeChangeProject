# Make Change Project

## Description
In this project that takes the inputs of cost and cash to calculate change.

## What I learned
This project was a lesson in methods. At first I calculated everything in while loops and nested if statements. After I identified that all the if statements had a pattern, I wanted to find a way to turn the pattern into a method. Utilizing methods allowed my code to be much more readable while simultaneously reducing the number of lines.

I ran into issues with rounding doubles when casting the cash value to an integer and required a bit of help from the TAs. Ultimately, the solution was multiplying the values by 100 and eliminating the decimals.

## Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Git
